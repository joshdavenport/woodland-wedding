## important bits 

### travel and transport

[The Dreys](https://goo.gl/maps/MvAhQwRPBMmsNPfz7) is in Sittingbourne, Kent just off the A249. The venue can be accessed directly from the A249 on Rumstead Lane.

The closest train stations are Newington, Bearsted and Hollingbourne which are around 15-20 minutes drive away.

please find some recommended taxi companies in our [local hotel info](/assets/local-hotel-info.pdf). we advise you book these ahead. uber is available but we don't know what the coverage is like.

### parking

the venue has a dedicated field for parking with ample space. vehicles can be left overnight but must be collected by 10am the next morning.

### dress code

there isn't one, just be aware that the day will be held outdoors and on natural ground, so pop on comfortable shoes or bring a spare pair just in case.

### weather

come prepared in case the rain makes an appearance! if you want to bring wellies, that’s cool but don’t worry, there’s plenty of shelter if needed.

## schedule for the day

the ceremony will begin at 2.30pm so please arrive with plenty of time.

there will be food served at around 5pm, as well as some small snacks beforehand, but be sure to start your day with a hearty breakfast so you aren’t hungry later!

there will also be some more food served later into the evening to keep you fuelled for dancing. there will be a bar on site that accepts card and cash.

please do let us know when you rsvp if you have any specific dietary requirements that we aren’t already aware of.
